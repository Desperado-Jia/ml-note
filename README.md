## What about it?
Personal theoretical derivation notes about Machine Learning, Deep Learning & Reinforcement Learning. 

The content is about the crazy things I did when I was 2017-2018 (when I was still studying). Maybe a lot of the content is outdated now, but you can kill time by reading it when you are sitting on the toilet.

## Motivation
Lay a solid theoretical foundation, and hope to create an interesting future with imaginative, enthusiastic algorithm engineers and scientists. AGI, here we come!
